This repo consits of codes for all the sensors and switches that I have covered during my internship. It contains individual sensor codes and the codes for sensors when combined.
All the codes work perfectly fine except for the servo motor which i'm still working on. Here is the list of sensors that I've covered-
LDR
LimiT Switch
DHT11
LDR sensor
RFID
Colour Sensor
IR speed sensor (speedometer)
Flex Sensor
Smoke sensor
Alcohol Sensor
Rain Sensor
Moisture Sensor
Flame Sensor
Ultrasonic SEnsor
Vibration sensor
Voltage sensor
LCD with I2C module
Keypad
Metal detector
IR sensor
Eye blink semsor
Touch sensor
Sound sensor
Finger heart rate sensor
BMP180
HC05 bluetooth module
Servo motor
